# Demonstration of Sparse Hadamard Single-Pixel Imaging Using the \( H_{64} \) Basis

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive framework for **Sparse Hadamard Single-Pixel Imaging (SHSI)** utilizing the \( H_{64} \) Hadamard basis. The implementation encompasses:

- Generation of randomized positive and negative sparse Hadamard speckle patterns derived from the \( H_{64} \) matrix.
- Simulation of single-pixel imaging data acquisition employing these speckle patterns.
- High-fidelity image reconstruction via the SHSI algorithm.
- Evaluation of noise robustness through additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) simulations.
- Quantitative assessment of reconstruction quality using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics.

## Repository Contents

- `Generate_hadamard_matrix_random_64_H.m`  
  Script to generate randomized sparse Hadamard speckle patterns based on the \( H_{64} \) matrix. The patterns are saved as PNG images along with the corresponding row and column indices required for SHSI reconstruction, as outlined in **Algorithm 1**:

- `Natural_Hadamard_Transform.m`  
  Function to generate Hadamard matrices of order \( 2^n \) via Sylvester's construction, yielding matrices in natural order.

- `SHSI.m`  
  Main demonstration script that:
  - Loads the generated speckle patterns and associated indices.
  - Loads and preprocesses a test image (e.g., Cameraman).
  - Simulates single-pixel measurements using the speckle patterns.
  - Performs image reconstruction via SHSI.
  - Assesses noise robustness by adding AWGN and comparing noisy and noise-free reconstructions.
  - Computes and displays PSNR values for quantitative evaluation.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Generate Hadamard Speckle Patterns**  
   Run `Generate_hadamard_matrix_random_64_H.m` to generate and save the positive and negative sparse Hadamard speckle patterns based on the \( H_{64} \) basis. The patterns and corresponding reconstruction indices will be stored under `./data/Random_Discrete_Hadamard_Postive_and_Negetive_matrix_64_H/`.

2. **Run the SHSI Reconstruction Demo**  
   Execute `SHSI.m` to simulate the single-pixel imaging acquisition and reconstruction process using the generated patterns.

  abstract = {Scattering presents significant challenges for practical imaging applications. Single-pixel imaging offers advantages over conventional approaches, yet further advances are still required. In this work, we introduce sparse Hadamard speckle patterns with tunable sparsity and propose sparse Hadamard single-pixel imaging (SHSI), a new framework built on these patterns. By integrating orthogonality, sparsity, and pseudo-randomness, the proposed patterns provide clear benefits over traditional Hadamard speckle patterns and their variants. SHSI improves noise robustness across a wide range of sampling rates by encoding sparse but spatially correlated information within each illumination pattern. It also achieves high-resolution imaging with low-order Hadamard matrices, which substantially reduces memory requirements. Moreover, SHSI operates without prior knowledge, training, or post-processing, thereby simplifying implementation. To further enhance performance, we introduce two operational modes and develop a complete theoretical framework that is validated through simulations and experiments. SHSI has the potential to advance computational imaging platforms based on sequential correlation measurements and to enable real-time reconstruction of occluded or embedded targets within scattering media.},
